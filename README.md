# TraceIt
An NCEA progress tracker for those who cannot be bothered counting their credits.

# Description

TraceIt â€“ Your Personal NCEA progress tracker

TraceIt was a personal project that evolved as part of a Computer Studies school assessment. I was annoyed that NZQA removed their very helpful progress tracker, whih allowed you to search for existing standards, add them, input your grades and calculate your progress via the several NCEA metrics.

I wasn't happy with the solutions that still existed on either the App Store or PLay Store, so I opted to create my own.

This was my first mobile application.

It allows standards to be selected and added to subjects, grades to be chosen for those standards, and then presents your progress visually through several chart types.

# Availability

TraceIt is currently available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/traceit-ncea-tracker/id1527893664) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bccodespace.traceit).

# Future support

Because of the substantial changes being made to NCEA, my business with regards to university study, and the tedious matter of keeping the embedded NCEA standards up-to-date, I will most likely not publish any further updates, and TraceIt may eventually disappear off both stores for not providing updates that support the latest respective iOS and Android SDK versions.

# Full disclosure (please read)

This was my first substantial programming project full-stop. Hence, you will find there is not much in terms of comments, if any at all. I wasn't aware of commenting as being an absolutely necessary practice, and figured (at the time) no one else would be reading my code.

I created an 'unstable' branch, which really was the only branch I worked on after a certain point.
